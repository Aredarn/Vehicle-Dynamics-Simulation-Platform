# VDSP
Simulation of a racecar in Angular/TS
## Motivation

This project is for myself to learn a bit more physics and get more experience. The purpose of this web-app is to simulate a specified car around a user-created track.

**These attributes are these at the moment:**
- Weight (Kg)
- Engine Power output (Kw)
- Drag Coefficient
- Frontal area (width*height of the car in m<sup>2</sup>)
- Tire grip (μ)
- Downforce (N)
- Final drive ratio (NOT YET WORKING)
- Wheelbase (in meter NOT YET WORKING)
